# Core Concepts & Architecture

This section provides architectural overviews and foundational knowledge about Open Ticket AI. Here you'll find explanations of the core design patterns, system architecture, and theoretical concepts that underpin the project.

## What Belongs Here

The `concepts/` directory is for **architectural and theoretical content** that explains *what* and *why*:

- **Pipeline architecture** - How the pipeline system is designed and why
- **Pipe lifecycle** - Understanding the pipe execution model
- **Dependency injection** - How the DI container works and its design
- **Rendering system** - Template rendering architecture
- **Context management** - State management across pipeline execution
- **Core design patterns** - Patterns used throughout the codebase

## What Doesn't Belong Here

If you're looking for:
- **Step-by-step tutorials** → See [Guides](/docs/guides/)
- **API reference** → See [Code](/docs/code/), [Configuration](/docs/configuration/), or [Plugins](/docs/plugins/)
- **Troubleshooting** → See [Guides](/docs/guides/troubleshooting)

## Content Coming Soon

This is a new section of the documentation. Content is being migrated and created to provide comprehensive architectural documentation. Check back soon for:

- Pipeline Architecture Deep Dive
- Pipe Execution Model
- Dependency Injection Patterns
- Template Rendering System
- And more...

## Contributing

When writing documentation for this section:

1. Focus on **what** and **why** rather than **how**
2. Explain design decisions and trade-offs
3. Use diagrams to illustrate architecture
4. Link to practical guides for implementation details

For more information on contributing to documentation, see the [AGENTS.md](../../../../../AGENTS.md) file.
