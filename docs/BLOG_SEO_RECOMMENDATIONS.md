# Ticket AI Labeling Guide: Automate 10,000 Tickets Efficiently

Building a ticket AI system starts with high-quality labeled data. Whether you're training a
ticket AI model from scratch or fine-tuning an existing system, efficiently labeling thousands
of support tickets is critical. This guide shows how to use GPT-powered pre-labeling and tools
like Open Ticket AI to reduce manual labeling effort by 80%.

## Why Ticket AI Needs Quality Labels

Ticket AI classification accuracy depends on training data quality. Manual labeling of 10,000
tickets can take weeks and cost thousands of dollars. This semi-automated approach using AI
pre-labeling cuts that time and cost dramatically while maintaining label quality.
